# CheesePlate
_Auxiliary Benchmark Suite for JerryScript_

Widespread JavaScript benchmark suites (e.g., SunSpider) don't necessarily cover
all aspects of the language, thus performance and memory usage improvements of
some aspects of an engine are sometimes hard to justify. *CheesePlate* collects
scripts that turn out to be useful during the development of the
[JerryScript](https://github.com/Samsung/jerryscript) engine.
